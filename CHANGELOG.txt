Commented functions:
  
  * Dataholder class commented out:

     A way to simply access the data in the lists without trouble 
     was figured out.
 
  * calMeanOfFrames function commented out:

     Number of frames used will now be fixed to 100 frames for consistency
     instead of using the mean of the frames.
  
  * vStackFeatures function commented out:

     Since Dataholder is no longer used, this function will no longer be needed.
     Stacking the features will now be done in audiospoof.py as the code is very
     short.

Changes:
  
  * getFeatures function:

     - frames now fixed to 100
     - It wil no longer extract features only from file D_100001.wav. 
       Instead, the file can now be manually selected.

Additions:
  * Added a main.py file. It will run everything and contains the GUI as well.
